1. Subject: Urgent: Water Leak in Bathroom Ceiling
To: Property Management Team
From: Emily Carter (Unit #4B, 22 Oak Lane, London, SW1A 2AB)

Dear Property Management Team,
I am writing to report a significant water leak in the bathroom ceiling of my flat (Unit #4B, 22 Oak Lane). Over the past week, brown stains and visible mold have formed, and water drips persistently. This poses a health hazard and risks further damage to the property. Please arrange for an inspection and repairs immediately. Iâ€™m concerned about potential structural issues or electrical wiring damage.

Thank you for prioritizing this.
Best regards,
Emily Carter

2. Subject: Infestation of Cockroaches in Kitchen
To: Greenview Property Management
From: James Patel (Unit #2D, 15 Willow Street, Manchester, M15 4FH)

Dear Ms. Thompson,
I regret to inform you that my flat (Unit #2D, 15 Willow Street) has been overrun by cockroaches, particularly in the kitchen and under appliances. Despite my efforts to clean thoroughly, the problem persists. I suspect neighboring units or shared ducts may be the source. Please coordinate a professional pest control service as soon as possible. This is unacceptable and violates habitability standards outlined in the lease.

Looking forward to your prompt response.
Sincerely,
James Patel

3. Subject: Heating System Failure During Winter
To: Metro Apartments Management
From: Sophie Clarke (Unit #7A, 5 Riverside Court, Birmingham, B3 1JP)

Hello Management Team,
The heating system in my flat (Unit #7A, 5 Riverside Court) has been non-functional for three days, making the indoor temperature unbearable. Temperatures are dropping below 10Â°C, and I have a young child at home. Iâ€™ve reset the thermostat multiple times without success. Request an urgent HVAC technician visit to resolve this. Given the extreme weather, I expect compensation for any space heaters Iâ€™ve had to purchase.

Please confirm a timeline for repairs.
Regards,
Sophie Clarke

4. Subject: Noise Complaint: Construction After Hours
To: City Heights Property Management
From: Daniel Wright (Unit #3B, 10 Parkview Apartments, Leeds, LS1 4DG)

Dear Mr. Harris,
This is my third complaint about construction noise from Flat #5C, which continues past 10 PM on weekdays. The drilling and hammering violate the leaseâ€™s "quiet hours" clause (Section 3.2). I work remotely and cannot focus, and my sleep is disrupted. Kindly enforce the rules or restrict construction to daytime hours. If unresolved, I may escalate this matter.

Thank you for your attention.
Best,
Daniel Wright

5. Subject: Broken Main Entry Door Lock â€“ Security Risk
To: Horizon Estates Management Office
From: Aisha Khan (Unit #6F, 8 Victoria Gardens, Glasgow, G2 3HQ)

To the Management Office,
The main entry door lock to our building (8 Victoria Gardens) has been broken for five days, leaving the premises accessible to non-residents. This is a severe security risk, especially as multiple packages have gone missing this week. I urge you to repair or replace the lock immediately and consider installing a camera system. My prior follow-ups have gone unansweredâ€”please treat this as urgent.

Sincerely,
Aisha Khan
